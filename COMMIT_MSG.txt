feat(frontend): General UX, WebSocket reliability, position detail & transactions

General page (System Health)
- Hide frontend/backend URLs by default with reveal (eye) icon
- Label as "Frontend Network" and "Backend Network"
- Place reveal icon inline next to URL text

WebSocket (use-websocket)
- Fix agent switch: reconnection was blocked by stale isConnected/isConnecting
  and wsRef not cleared on close; use readyState and clear wsRef in onclose
- Fix live data drop-off: connect() guard now uses ref-based readyState check
  so auto-reconnect runs after unexpected disconnect

Live positions & position detail dialog
- Derive selectedPosition from live positions by ID so dialog always has
  up-to-date data (DCA/TP IDs, prices) instead of a stale snapshot
- Position detail: only reset purchase tab when opening a different position
  (position?.id), not on every price-update re-render
- Position detail: fetch DCA and take-profit transactions via API using
  signalId + isDca/isTakeProfit instead of dcaTransactionIds/takeProfitTransactionIds
  from WebSocket (avoids empty arrays from pipeline)
- Position detail: show "Failed to load" + Retry when transaction queries error

Transactions page
- Show DCA and Take profit badges on transaction cards and table rows
- Keep Signal # display; adjust layout for badges (flex wrap, gap)
